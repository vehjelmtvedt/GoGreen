### How dow we calculate the amount of C02 a user saves?
- The main idea is that we calulate how much c02 a user produces annualy according to carbonindependent, then divive it by 365 to calculate how much they produce daily. So each time a user performs a "green activity" we calculate the amount of c02 they save according to their daily emissions. This implies that an activity can actually save 0 c02. Of course there is also a limit on how much c02 someone can save per day for each activity.
