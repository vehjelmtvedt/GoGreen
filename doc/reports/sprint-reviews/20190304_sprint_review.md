<!-- An example of how you can do a sprint review -->

# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Uneven work distribution
Our team had a problem with the work distribution, such that the backend has to wait on the frontend to start working.
We have decided to fix the problem by more careful planning, intermediate deadlines and by having the backend people
help out on other parts of the project.

### Problem 2: Technical Issues
Some minor technical issues with JDK8. We have decided to switch to JDK11 and guiding each team member to go through with it.

### Problem 3: Too much focus on bonus features
We have decided to focus more on the actual demo requirements and delivering the MAIN features of the application rather than
working more on bonus features.

### Problem 4: Team coordination
Our team had issues with coordinating between certain features. For example, people on the frontend did not know what exactly
to implement so that their functionality works on the backend. We have decided to coordinate our efforts more between groups of people.

## Adjustments from previous sprints
 - CI integration to solve Checkstyle & Test Coverage
    - Team mates are now encouraged to write tests & fix checkstyle errors to pass the pipeline
 - Code modularity
    - The team now takes extra care in making sure that their code can easily be expanded by other team members
 - Approvals for merge requests
    - The team now goes through at least 1 approval before (almost) each merge request
 - Code review
    - The team now pays more attention to code review (and fixes the issues) to make sure that everything is in order
  - Even workload
    - We have set up more issues for each team member to work on 

## Adjustments for next sprint
  - Agreement on work distribution (if group members run out of work, they should contact the team and help out in other parts)
  - Focus on MAIN features
  - Coordinate team work more between branches
