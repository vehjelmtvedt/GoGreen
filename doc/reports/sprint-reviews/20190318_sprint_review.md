# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Pushing directly to develop
We had some issues where some team members pushed directly on develop, rather than branching and making these changes. As a result, we have also decided to protect the develop branch.

### Problem 2: Code reviews
So far, we have lacked code reviewing, as we have focused on making code suggestions in private communications in WhatsApp. Therefore, this week onwards, we will focus more 
on actually doing the code rewviews
 
### Problem 3: Cross-merging branches
So far, we have sometimes been doing cross-merges between branches. This is quite an issue at the end, when we want to merge our finished work into develop. This also
caused issues, such as code errors. Therefore, we have decided to generally avoid this as much as possible.

## Adjustments from previous sprints
  - The work is now properly distributed and each team member has sufficient work
  - Coordination has highly improved, since we have started paying more attention to it

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Avoid cross branches
 - Take up code reviews
 - Completely avoid pushing directly to develop/master
